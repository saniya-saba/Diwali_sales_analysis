# Diwali Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance during the Diwali festival.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze Diwali sales data to uncover patterns and trends that can help businesses make informed decisions. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide a link or description of the source]. It includes detailed sales information such as transaction dates, customer demographics, product categories, and sales amounts.

## Objectives

1. **Performed Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Ensured data quality by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
2. **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the data.
3. **Improved Customer Experience:** Identified potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups to enhance targeting strategies.
4. **Improved Sales:** Identified top-selling product categories and products, which can help in planning inventory to meet demand effectively.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. **Visualization:** Creating visualizations to illustrate key findings and support data-driven decision-making.
